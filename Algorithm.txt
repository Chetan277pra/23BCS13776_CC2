Algorithm for the code:
1. Start
2. get low = min(a, b)
3. high = min(a,b)*n

We have limit on which we'll apply binary search 

l = (long)(a/gcd(a, b)*b) //This is lcm to subtract multiple counts

while(low<high)
    mid = low + (high-low)/2

    count = (mid / a) + (mid / b) - (mid / l)

    if (count < n) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid;
            }

return count
